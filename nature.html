            <h3 class="headline">Nature</h3>
            <h3 class="intro_text">Hawaii is known as a heaven on earth and as a paradise. Do you want to know why? It is because Hawaii hide a lot of beauty in each of his islands. Cascading waterfalls, hidden caves, rainforests, variety of beaches with blue-sky waters, national parks, volcanoes and beautiful sunsets. I could write about a thousand fantastic natural attractions found across the Hawaiian islands, but these few are some of the best and you should see them! </h3>

            <p class="source">Glass Beach (source: onlyinyourstate.com)</p>
            <p class="intro_text">Hawaii is undoubtedly known for its incredible beaches. One of them is Glass Beach, a brilliant beach covered with millions of sea glass pebbles in brilliant hues of aqua, blue and brown. The glass found at this beach was mainly created from broken bottles and auto glass that was dumped years ago, and subsequently smoothed by time and ocean tides.</p>

            <img src="Kalapama.jpeg" alt="nature" class="nature">

            <p class="source">Kalapama (source: inverse.com)</p>
            <p class="intro_text">There are very few places on this planet where you can watch flowing lava in person, and even fewer where you can walk right up to it. Kalapana is the safest and easiest to access. There are two paths you can take: one from the east at Kalapana and one from the west, near Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Not only might you see flowing lava, but you’ll be walking along the youngest land you’ve ever set foot on.</p>

 <h3 class="headline1">

</h3>

            <p class="source">Mauna Loa (source: onlyinyourstate.com)</p>
            <p class="intro_text">Each Hawaiian Island is home to at least one volcano. Mauna Loa located in Hawaii Island has long been considered the largest subaerial volcano on earth in terms of both mass and volume. The name Mauna Loa translates to "Long Mountain" in Hawaiian, an apt name for a volcano that accounts for more than half of Hawaii island’s land mass. The volcano last erupted from March 24 to April 15, 1984. </p>

            <p class="source">Kaneohe Sandbar (source: wanderlustyle.com)</p>
            <p class="intro_text">It is a slice of paradise that is only accessible during low tide. The Kaneohe sandbar, located in the middle of Kaneohe Bay surrounded by the striking Ko’olau mountains, features crystalline turquoise waters, fine white sand, and plenty of fun. At high tide, you can comfortably stand waist-deep in the water, while at low tide, the sand is completely exposed. Most people while go there bring a ton of food, drinks and play volleyball.</p>

<h3 class="headline1">Punalu’u Black Sand Beach, Hawaii Island</h3>

            <img src="punaluu.jpg" alt="nature" class="nature">

            <p class="source">Black sand beach (source: droneandslr.com)</p>
            <p class="intro_text">The Punaluu Beach on Hawaii’s Big Island is one of the most unique beaches in the world! The beach is a black sand beach that has been made of basalt and created by lava flowing into the ocean which cools almost instantly as it touches the water.</p>
